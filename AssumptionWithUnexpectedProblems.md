### **Development Assumptions**

1. **Console Output Only**  
   For simplicity in this demo, all messages are printed to the console without formal logging infrastructure.

2. **Line Width Definition**  
   The minimum detectable line width is **1 pixel**.

3. **Line Length Threshold**  
   Vertical lines shorter than **5 pixels** are ignored.

4. **Performance Consideration**  
   The implementation uses single-threaded processing for simplicity.  
   *Note: Multithreading could optimize performance but is excluded for demo purposes.*

5. **Testing Scope**  
   No formal test cases are included in this demo version.

6. **Line Density Rules**  
   - Multiple vertical lines may exist in the same pixel column.  
   - The minimum gap between adjacent vertical lines is **1 pixel**.

7. **Visual Line Composition**  
   - A visual vertical line may comprise multiple fragmented pixel-aligned lines.  
   - Fragments are merged into a single visual line if:  
     - They are vertically adjacent (same column).  
     - Gaps between fragments are â‰¤ **5 pixels** (default tolerance).
